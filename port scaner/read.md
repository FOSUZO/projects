# Asynchronous Port Scanner with FastAPI

## Project Overview
This is an **asynchronous port scanner** built using **Python** and **FastAPI**. The application allows users to scan a host or IP address for open ports and view the results in a clean, user-friendly web interface.

The project demonstrates skills in:
- Asynchronous programming (`asyncio`)
- Web development with FastAPI
- HTML/CSS templating
- Handling user input securely
